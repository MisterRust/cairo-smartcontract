## What is it?
Eykar is a decentralized strategy game project developed by two college friends. The idea is to create a math formula describing an infinite game board. This formula is able to give us the shape of each plot, its altitude, its climate, its color and all this while keeping a coherence between the different biomes and regions. Players can then explore this infinite world, colonize it and develop their empire. Since the math formula is deterministic, only changes to the world are stored on the blockchain. And because we are using the layer 2 StarkNet, a Validity-Rollup, we can afford to implement realistic distance calculations and other complex interactions without paying a very high cost.

## To do list
- [ ] Minting colonies
- [ ] Getting plot at (x,y)
- [ ] Getting multiple plots on (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)
- [ ] Delayed Tasks System
- [ ] Conquering (x, y, colonyId, troops)
- [ ] Attacking (x, y, colonyId, troops)
- [ ] Sending resources (colonyId, colonyId, resources)
